# Artificial-Neural-Network-and-Logistic-regression-for-prediction-of-Bankruptcy-in-Polish-companies1
This is a binary classification project where I have implemented Artificial Neural Network with dropout layer and compared it with base level model called Logistic Regression to predict bankruptcy in polish companies. The data contains 64 financial indicators of a company and a label 1 if the company went bankrupt and label 0 if the company did not bankrupt. These financial indicators are considered as features for the purpose of this project. The data available is generally
imbalanced because few companies go bankrupt and most do no go bankrupt. This means that the
trained model predicts successful (majority class) companies even when some of those firms are
distressed. This contributes to the model's predictive capability.
